# Project0 / Project0-AI
Simple online game of Noughts & Crosses, either two player or human vs. computer (easy version).

## Get it running:
* Open in your browser using: https://katshaze.github.io/project0
* That page has a link to the AI (Easy) version, but if you're only interested in the AI version, it's here: https://katshaze.github.io/project0-AI
* (Tested browsers so far include Chrome and Safari)

## Built with:
* JavaScript (& jQuery)
* HTML & CSS

## Game features include:
* Alternating starting player
* Winner of each game displayed on screen (inc. special effects)
* Wins tallied (until a screen refresh)
* Click anywhere reset function each time a game ends
* Play against the computer (easy) version (the two versions are separate web pages with a button linking them to each other)

## Extra snazzy bits
* Blowfish puffs up for a win.

## Problematic bits
* Winning combinations code are a bit hardcoded; not very efficient for scaling into a larger board.
* Updates to style & functionality mean updating both versions since they've been separated, causing extra work

## TODO
* Special effect for a win by X (player two/computer)
* Players to be able to choose their icons
* Link two player and AI version into single webpage
* Maaaaaybe have a crack at creating an AI (hard) version
