## Extra snazzy bits
<ul>
<li>Blowfish puffs up for a win.</li>
</ul>

## Sticky points
<ul>
<li>AI version bugs, e.g. human can click in a spot already taken and the computer will take this as its cue to play its turn.</li>
<li>Winning combinations code is too hardcoded; not yet useful for knowing _which_ squares are the winning squares or for scaling into a larger board.</li>
</ul>

## What next
<ul>
<li>Special effect for a win by X (player two/computer)</li>
<li>Players to be able to choose their icons
<li>Link two player and AI version into single webpage</li>
<li>Maaaaaybe have a crack at creating an AI (hard) version</li>
</ul>
